# Markdown example doc

Recommonmark is used with Markdown (`.md`) source files to convert them for
Sphinx.

## Second level header

Sphinx with recommonmark will build documents that are Markdown (`.md`) format.

Note: recommonmark can not convert Markdown documents that have been specified
in a `.rst` file using the `.. include::` directive.
